# Reference Site for Medium Article Readers
I mention in my Medium articles that learning to generate synthetic data is a critical skill set for any technologist, coder, or programmer. The repos on this site contain the MVP core of a singularly unique design to generating data - its all down out of thin air with no dependencies on anything other than a gcc compiler.

The technolgy does not require any third-party libraries and can be compiled on any target system that supports the GCC compiler tools or compliant ANSI standard compilers. Information about the commercial version of the technology will be coming in future articles.

You can ask me questions via the comments section provided by the Medium platform next to each article.
