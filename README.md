# Reference Site for Medium Article Readers
I mention in a Medium article in the publication INTO DATA SCIENCE that learning to generate synthetic data is a critical skill set for a data scientist. The repos on this site contain the MVP core I mentioned in the article.

Information about the commercial version of the Synthetic IO technology can be found at www.syntheticio.com website. The technolgy does not require any third-party libraries and can be compiled on any target system that supports the GCC compiler tools or compliant ANSI standard compilers. We license the software based on the target platform and the number of servers. We also license access for corportions using a closed source model.

You can also find links to the Amazon AWS Marketplace listing on our website. You can contact me by sending email to support@syntheticio.com
